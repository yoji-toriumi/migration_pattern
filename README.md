## Migration Pattern

This project wrangles worldwide migration data extracted from the following URL for visualizing migration flows using ArcGIS. 

To run the code, you download the migration data file in the Data – [Destination and origin], and save it as csv file in your R-project folder. 
Also, you download the country boundary data and store the folder in your R-project folder.
