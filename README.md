This project wrangles worldwide migration data extracted from the following URL for visualizing migration flows using ArcGIS. 

To run the code, you download the migration data file in the Data – [Destination and origin], and save it as csv file in your R-project folder. 
Also, you download the country boundary data and store the folder in your R-project folder.
